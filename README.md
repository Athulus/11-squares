# 11-squares

based on https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/553420d3bb57c2bf87000059

There are a grid of 12 squares. the missing square tells the hour. the text in that space gives you the minute. tap on the text to cycle between: minutes, heart rate, steps, battery percentage.

you can change the color of the squares on  your phone via the watch face settings.

## Building
this is an export of the code from [fitbit studio](https://studio.fitbit.com). In order to build to a watch or the fitbit emulator you must import this code into a new fitbit studio project. The only way I currently know to do this is by dragging and dropping all of the folders and files from this repo into a blank fitbit studio project.

## Contributions
If you want to make grab this code and make changes, please do. If you think your changes would benefit my project as well make a pull request with your changes and I will review them.
